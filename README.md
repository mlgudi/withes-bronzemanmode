# withes-bronzemanmode

A plugin made to closely represent the idea of a custom old school runescape gamemode called bronze man mode originally thought off by MLGudi.
Bronzemanmode is like ironman but with one crucial difference, once you obtain a item either through a drop or through a playerkill you "unlock" it. Items that are unlocked are able to be bought from the Grand Exchange.
