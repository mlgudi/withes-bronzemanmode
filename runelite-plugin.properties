description=A plugin made to closely represent the idea of a custom old school runescape gamemode called bronze man mode originally thought off by MLGudi. Bronzemanmode is like ironman but with one crucial difference, once you obtain a item either through a drop or through a playerkill you "unlock" it. Items that are unlocked are able to be bought from the Grand Exchange. Watch this video for a overview of the unofficial rules and the way this was intended to be played https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFNfa2saOJg&t=62s
